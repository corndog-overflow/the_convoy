2025 Senior Design Capstone; Team 10: The Convoy

Sponsored by The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory


A robotic convoy that seamlessly collaborates as one unit, though segmented into individual actors, each communicating effectively to survey their environment with high degrees of accuracy.
With robust autonomous navigation systems, the convoy engages in follow the leader behavior and obstacle avoidance to traverse dynamic environments for use in fields like agriculture, disaster relief and medical environments.
This high level of autonomy reduces bottlenecks in safety and productivity.
